# Anger-Management
## The files presented here show the logic behind production of Anger Management itself:-
* The [**AdminLogin.cs script**](AdminLogin.cs) is a third party script utilized to add a "log-in" feature to the tool itself.
* The [**DestroyButton.cs script**](DestroyButton.cs)focuses on providing a sense of control and calmness to the patient when he/she has provided their thoughts about the choices they made.
* Finally, the [**LerpSound script**](LerpSound.cs) is responsible for creating a slowly increasing sound-effect within the game.
* Finally, the [**SceneLoader script**](SceneLoader.cs) is simply used to transition between in-game scenes.

### Additionally, there are 2 Videoclips (Links included) which will give you a run-through of what to expect in the game and the internal sections of each script.
